          We were started by allergy sufferers as a convenient and easy
          alternative to allergy shots. We believe that all allergy sufferers
          should have access to at-home prescription allergy relief. Our process
          is simple, with all virtual visits and payments that is simple and
          easy.

          Our founders have gone through years and years of weekly allergy shot
          appointments. They have been sitting in the doctorâ€™s office just like
          you. Now they still take daily under-the-tongue treatments. With
          multiple clinicians and years of medical experience, our team is
          excited to show you the treatment that has helped so many people.
