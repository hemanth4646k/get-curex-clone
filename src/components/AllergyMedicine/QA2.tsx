            Dealing with pet allergies can be a real hassle. The first step is
            to create pet-free zones in your home—preferably your bedroom, at
            the very least. Regular cleaning, using a HEPA filter in your
            vacuum, and washing bedding in hot water can help reduce allergens.
            Consider using allergy-proof covers on pillows and mattresses
            too.When it comes to medication, over-the-counter antihistamines
            like cetirizine (Zyrtec) or loratadine (Claritin) can provide
            relief. Nasal corticosteroid sprays like fluticasone (Flonase) can
            also help with nasal symptoms. If it's particularly bad, you might
            want to consult with an allergist who can recommend a more
            personalized approach, such as allergy shots or prescription
            medications.
