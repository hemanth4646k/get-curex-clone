          At Curex, we're dedicated to enhancing convenience and affordability
          in healthcare. While insurance coverage for allergy drops is currently
          unavailable, your clinical consultations may be covered depending on
          your plan! This results in a lower monthly subscription cost for
          allergy drops if you are using insurance. For those without insurance
          or with out-of-network plans, we offer the most affordable self-pay
          immunotherapy plan in the United States!

          As a valued patient at Curex, a minimum of 6 consultations are
          recommended with an insurance plan.
        </b>
            However, this doesn't guarantee payment, as your health insurance
          company may deny payment for any service. If your insurance company
          denies payment, you will be personally and fully responsible for
          payment after services are rendered, including any co-payment,
          non-covered portions, deductible amount, or coinsurance that applies.
          <br /><br />
          Curex cannot accurately estimate how much your insurance will pay and
          how much you will be responsible for paying. The average patient
          responsibility is $200/year and depends on your plan (deductibles,
          coinsurance, telemedicine benefit). <br /><br /> We encourage you to call the
          number on the back of your insurance card and ask your member
          representative about your 'allergy, asthma, and telemedicine visit'
          benefits. Once a claim is submitted, we are unable to take it back. By
          proceeding, you agree to pay any additional charges that may be
          incurred that are not covered by your insurance policy.

If you don't meet this requirement, Curex may transition your account to a self-pay plan.

Please ensure you schedule your six consultations annually to continue enjoying your current benefits.</p>
