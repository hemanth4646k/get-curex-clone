    question: "Does Curex accept insurance?",
    answer:
      "Curex accepts the majority of insurance plans across the United States, including Aetna, Anthem, BlueCross BlueShield, United, Humana and others. While it is difficult to estimate out-of-pocket costs prior to a claim being submitted, our team will work with you to make sure your treatment is as affordable as possible. For that purpose, we also cap copays at $400/year. In addition, Curex accepts HSA and FSA. Please note that insurance covers clinical consultations, while subscription fee ($59/month, not billed to insurance) covers immunotherapy, shipping & related costs.",

    question: "What is your cancellation policy?",
    answer:
      "Treatments are shipped in 3 month installments in all plans. Cancellations are accepted prior to the next refill being compounded by the pharmacy (so you can get a partial refund on a prepayment plan). To cancel or pause subscriptions, please email our team at hi@getcurex.com.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the ingredients?",
    answer:
      "The composition of sublingual allergy drops depends on the specific allergens a person is sensitive to, as determined by allergy testing. Allergy drops may contain pollens, dust mites, pet dander, mold, and glycerin. Extracts are FDA approved medications produced in a highly controlled environment. A licensed pharmacy prepared the formulation for each patient after receiving a doctorâ€™s prescription.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does allergy testing work?",
    answer:
      "Depending on your location, we send a phlebotomist (medical assistant) to your home or office for a simple blood draw (not a finger prick). This sample is then processed using hospital-grade technology to produce accurate results. In some areas, you may need to go into a local lab for your blood draw. We work with LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics. This is an IgE blood test that results in more accurate results compared to finger prick tests that are available online through some companies. This is not a skin scratch test where an allergist spends 30+ minutes injecting you with small doses of allergens to see if any swelling or reaction occurs.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is sublingual immunotherapy safe?",
    answer:
      "At-home sublingual immunotherapy is a safe alternative to allergy shots that can be done at the comfort of your home. Due to its gentle, gradual build-up phase, the risk of severe reactions is extremely low compared to allergy shots, which require monitoring post-injection.",
